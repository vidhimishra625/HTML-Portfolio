<h2>My top-3 Movies of all the time</h2>

<hr/>

<h3>Taare Zameen Par</h3>
<p>This is one on the best movies that I have ever come across. It beautifully depicts the relation of a teacher and student.</p>

<h3>3-Idiots</h3>
<p>This is one of the best movies that is made on the life of Engineers. It is the one with which we all can relate.</p>

<h3>Inception</h3>
<p>It is one of the best sci-fi movies that has an enthralling plot right from the beginning to the end. It has marvelously depicted the concept of time travel.</p>
